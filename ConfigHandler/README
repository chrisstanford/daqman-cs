1. Installing
-------------
No configuraiton or install utilities are provided. To compile, simply type
 > make

This library requires boost headers v1.35 or greater. 
By default, the MessageHandler utitlies also require the boost_thread library
to be installed. To bypass this requirement, compile with 
 > make MULTIRHEAD=false

In this case, Messages will not be thread safe, and will slow down the 
thread in which they are issued.

2. Usage
-------------
